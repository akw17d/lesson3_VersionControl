            <p class="lead">A version control system, also known as VCS, is used for software configuration management. It can be used when making changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. Changes made within these forms are usually given a number which can be refered to as a "revision". For example, the first revision could be named "revision1". This pattern continues with "revision2" etc. Within each of these files, programers can compare, restore, or even merge them. Using these revisions are extemel useful for programers to see where their work has progressed from. They are usually set up as stand alone applications. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many advantages that come with managing and changing the configuration of version control systems. It allows multiple programmers to work on the same application. Allowing us to share files and compare each others work. Sometimes, programmers get into each others work and mae modifications for each other to improve their code to perform better. Version Control Systems help coders improve and connect their code with others. By modifying and comparing other programmers work. It also allows users to compare differences within each others code. In which case, we can merge the codes. Programmers also have the option to have their own code, where only they can modify and change it. VCS is a greaat program for coders to create their best code. </p>

            <p class="lead">Git Hub is a web based hosting device that is used for version control systems within Git. As stated before, a Version Control System is a program that gives coders the freedom to collaborate their work with others. Git Hub is mainly used for computer code. It also offers all kinds of features for programmers to collaberat their work including bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project. The free account son Git Hub are often used when programmers want to host open source software projects. But they also offer private repositories for programmers who are working on lowkey projects.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git comes with all kinds of commands. Some of the more basic git commands include commit, push, pull and clone. When creating this project we used the "commit" command to conform the program. We used "config" to set our names and emails. When we wrote $ git config --global user.name "Arianna Wittig", we were storing our so called "paperwork" for Git. We did this same thing when we used the $ git onfig --global user.email "akw17d@my.fsu.edu". These entries are required when first starting up Git. All commands begin with "git". Git helps restore code that was initially thought to be lost, this is the beauty of it!</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Setting up a repository was slightly discussed in my previous explaination on Git commands. The repository is useful when setting up Git. It can be viewed as the paperwork nessesary for filling out when you first join a bank. The repository is like the virtual storage of a programmers project. Programmers are able to save certain versions of their code as they wish, then return to that code at any given time. Git init is a one time command used in the initial set up of a new repository. Never git add, commit, or push sensitive information to a remote repository. Sensitive information can include, but is not limited to passwords, SSH keys, API keys, and more. </p>
